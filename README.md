## TO DOs
A lot can be fine tuned. Maybe I'll spend a bit of time playing around with it in the future
1. a11y (add more accessbility support)
2. i18n (refactor all text out)
3. play with some text animation, and transition animation
4. refactor code for testing, important apis and functions should be provided with context or a similar provider(redux)
